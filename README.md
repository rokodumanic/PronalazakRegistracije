Neural network that finds the registration plate on a car.
The project was built in Google Colaboratory using Darknet and YOLOv4.
Darknet is a neural network architecture that is compatible with YOLO algorithms.
The dataset consists of over 600 pictures of cars which are later resized so the width and height are  multiples of 32.
